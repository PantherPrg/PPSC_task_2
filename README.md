# PPSC_task_2: Nearest Airport

You are a pilot, carrying 500 people, and you're not even halfway to your intended destination. Boom! You have received news that a supersonic bird has barely grazed your fuel tank and it is leaking. Immediately, you ask your assistant pilot to locate all of the nearest airports for an emergency landing. She returns with 4 pairs of integer coordinates (lists A, B, C, D), and using your python program you made in a high school club, you quickly land at the nearest strip becoming a hero. 

** Make sure to put another newline at the end of your returned result, otherwise it will not pass the testcase.*
